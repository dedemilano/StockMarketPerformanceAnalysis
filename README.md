# Stock Market Performance Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing stock market performance by calculating moving averages, measuring volatility, and conducting correlation analysis. The aim is to gain a deeper understanding of the factors that affect stock prices and the relationships between the stock prices of different companies.
